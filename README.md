# My Daily Journal

## Date: March 17, 2025

### What I worked on today:

- **Implemented basic Django project structure.**
- **Created models for the to-do list app.**
- **Set up basic views and templates.**
- **Tested the app locally.**
- **Pushed the code to GitHub after resolving some issues.**

### Challenges faced:

- Encountered issues with pushing large files to GitHub. Resolved by removing unnecessary files and pushing the required ones.
- Took time to understand GitHub's file size limitations.

### Goals for tomorrow:

- Implement task reminders.
- Set up the database and test migrations.
- Start working on authentication for the app.
